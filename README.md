# Nu - Small Lazy Stream Javascript Library #

A small library for working with lazy streams in Javascript.

See http://mattbierner.github.io/nu/


# Code #
Nu is written in Javascript / Khepri. [Khepri][khepri] is a ECMAScript subset
that, among other things, adds a shorted lambda function syntax. It is also
implemented using Nu. Besides lambda functions, Khepri files (*.kep) are
pretty much plain old Javascript.

For now, both the .js and .kep versions of source code will be kept in 'lib/',
but only Khepri sources will be developed and Javascript files will be
generated from it.
